I’ve always wondered if it’s possible to write code that can solve Sudoku puzzles.

Finally, I started working on it and managed to write code that can solve Sudoku,
although it’s not yet ready for the most difficult puzzles.

If you know any strategies to tackle the hardest ones, please share them with me so I can add them to my code.
